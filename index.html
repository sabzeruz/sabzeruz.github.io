                                <h3>Genshin Impact: the video game that's slowly taking over the world</h3>
                                    <p>Genshin Impact seems to have come from nowhere. A month ago nobody knew what it was.</p>
                                    <p>It has raked in more than <strong>$100m (£75m)</strong> in its first two weeks, placing it among the Chinese games industry’s most successful forays into the global scene. 
                                        That’s because it’s a pretty good game that looks, sounds and feels expensive, but is available for free – at least at face value.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Like Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – which it heavily resembles, at least on a surface level – Genshin Impact is an action-packed role-playing game with a huge world, chock-full of gorgeous vistas to explore by running, climbing and gliding. 
                                        The appearance might be similar but the feeling is significantly different. Breath of the Wild’s aesthetic is based on the beauty and solitude of nature; Genshin, by contrast, is the theme park version of that.
                                        Where BotW was content to merely hint at hidden treasures and leave vast spaces in-between, you can’t go 30 seconds in Genshin without tripping over some glowy object or mysterious chest. A constant stream of new weapons, trinkets, crafting materials, coins and characters to play with makes it dangerously easy to keep playing.
                                    </p>

                                <h3>Genshin Impact: the video game that's slowly taking over the world</h3>
                                    <p>Honkai: Star Rail starts with a bang, serenading you with a symphony and blowing up a space station. You quickly ground yourself in a world with code-locked chrome doors, mech-like invaders with bladed arms, and rooms with monitors spread across the walls.
                                         Its hook of a prologue gives just enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking around for without grinding.</p>
                                    <p>Charming characters, engaging combat, and carefully crafted worlds blend together into a game with enough content to keep you entertained for well over 50 hours, using polished versions of the progression systems from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact to create HoYoverse’s best RPG yet.</p>
                                    <p>
