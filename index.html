                                <h3>Genshin Impact: the video game that's slowly taking over the world</h3>
                                    <p>Genshin Impact seems to have come from nowhere. A month ago nobody knew what it was.</p>
                                    <p>It has raked in more than <strong>$100m (£75m)</strong> in its first two weeks, placing it among the Chinese games industry’s most successful forays into the global scene. 
                                        That’s because it’s a pretty good game that looks, sounds and feels expensive, but is available for free – at least at face value.

                                        Like Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – which it heavily resembles, at least on a surface level – Genshin Impact is an action-packed role-playing game with a huge world, chock-full of gorgeous vistas to explore by running, climbing and gliding.

                                         Its hook of eleprologue gives just enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking around for without grinding.

The game takes place in the future where humanity is on a 3rd war against the Honkai after centuries since their first and second encounters.</p>
